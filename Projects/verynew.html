<h1>Welcome to The Sindh Academy of Mathematics!</h1>
<p>Mathematics is often considered one of the most challenging subjects in school, but whether you enjoy the subject or not, it is a fundamental part of our everyday lives, and it is the language of science, technology, and engineering. From calculating the tip on a restaurant bill to designing the latest smartphone, mathematics is integral to many aspects of modern society.</p>
<p>Mathematics is one of the most important subjects. Mathematics is a subject of numbers, shapes, data, measurements and also logical activities. It has a huge scope in every field of our life, such as medicine, engineering, finance, natural science, economics, etc. We are all surrounded by a mathematical world.</p>
<p>The concepts, theories and formulas that we learn in Maths books have huge applications in real-life. To find the solutions for various problems we need to learn the formulas and concepts. Therefore, it is important to learn this subject to understand its various applications and significance.</p>

<h1>Branches of Mathematics:</h1>
The main branches of mathematics are:
<div class="number">
<dl>
<dt><h2>Number System</h2></dt>
<dd>A number system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers. It is the mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. It provides a unique representation of every number and represents the arithmetic and algebraic structure of the figures.</dl>
</div>
<div class="number">
<dt><h2>Algebra</h2></dt>
<dd>Algebra helps solve the mathematical equations and allows to derive unknown quantities, like the bank interest, proportions, percentages. We can use the variables in the algebra to represent the unknown quantities that are coupled in such a way as to rewrite the equations.

The algebraic formulas are used in our daily lives to find the distance and volume of containers and figure out the sales prices as and when needed. Algebra is constructive in stating a mathematical equation and relationship by using letters or other symbols representing the entities. The unknown quantities in the equation can be solved through algebra.

Some of the main topics coming under algebra include Basics of algebra, exponents, simplification of algebraic expressions, polynomials, quadratic equations, etc.</dd>
</div>
<div class="number">
<dt><h2>Geometry</h2></dt>
<dd>Geometry is the study of different types of shapes, figures and sizes in Maths or in real life. In geometry, we learn about different angles, transformations and similarities in the figures. 

The basics of geometry depend on majorly point, line, angles and plane. All the geometrical shapes are based on these basic geometrical concept<br>
Branches of Geometry
The branches of geometry are categorized as:

Algebraic geometry
Discrete geometry
Differential geometry
Euclidean geometry
Convex geometry
Topology
</dd>
</div>
<div class="number">
<dt><h2>Calculus</h2></dt>
<dd>Calculus, a branch of Mathematics, developed by Newton and Leibniz, deals with the study of the rate of change. Calculus Math is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions. It helps us to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function. Calculus Math mainly focused on some important topics such as differentiation, integration, limits, functions, and so on.

Calculus Mathematics is broadly classified into two different such:

Differential Calculus
Integral Calculus
</dd>
</div>
<div class="number">
<dt><h2>Trigonometry</h2></dt>
<dd>Trigonometry is one of the most important branches in mathematics that finds huge application in diverse fields. The branch called “Trigonometry” basically deals with the study of the relationship between the sides and angles of the right-angle triangle.  Hence, it helps to find the missing or unknown angles or sides of a right triangle using the trigonometric formulas, functions or trigonometric identities. In trigonometry, the angles can be either measured in degrees or radians. Some of the most commonly used trigonometric angles for calculations are 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°. <br>
The two different types of trigonometry are:

Plane Trigonometry
Spherical Trigonometry
</dd>
</div>
<div class="number">
<dt><h2>Probability and Statistics</h2></dt>
<dd>Probability And Statistics are the two important concepts in Maths. Probability is all about chance.Probability denotes the possibility of the outcome of any random event. The meaning of this term is to check the extent to which any event is likely to happen.<br>
Statistics has a huge scope in many fields such as sociology, psychology, geology, weather forecasting, etc.Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It is a method of collecting and summarising the data. This has many applications from a small scale to large scale. Whether it is the study of the population of the country or its economy, stats are used for all such data analysis.
</dd>
</dl>
These mathematical concepts fall under pure mathematics. These form the base of mathematics. In our academics we will come across all these theories and fundamentals to solve questions based on them.

Applied mathematics is another form, where mathematicians, scientists or technicians use mathematical concepts to solve practical problems. It describes the professional use of mathematics.
